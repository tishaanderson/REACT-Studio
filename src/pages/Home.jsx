Coming from a small town, I aim to simplify technology for everyday people and support small businesses. As the first woman in my family to graduate from college, I'm inspired to create generational wealth. Eager to learn and grow, I approach challenges with an open mind and commitment to excellence. My goal is to make a meaningful impact beyond the tech world, fostering trust and economic growth in local communities. Join me as we explore the intersection of technology and community, united in creating a more supportive global community.
